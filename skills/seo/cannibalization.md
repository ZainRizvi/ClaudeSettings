# Keyword Cannibalization Detection

## Cannibalization Types

**Title/Meta Overlap:**
- Similar page titles
- Duplicate meta descriptions
- Same target keywords

**Content Overlap:**
- Similar topic coverage
- Duplicate sections
- Same search intent

## Prevention Strategy

1. Clear keyword mapping - one primary keyword per page
2. Distinct search intent - different user needs
3. Unique angles - different perspectives
4. Differentiated metadata
5. Strategic consolidation when appropriate

## Output Format

```
Conflict: [Keyword]
Competing Pages:
- Page A: [URL]
- Page B: [URL]

Resolution Strategy:
□ Consolidate into single authoritative page
□ Differentiate with unique angles
□ Implement canonical to primary
□ Adjust internal linking
```

- Merge similar content
- 301 redirect weak pages
- Rewrite for different intent
- Update internal anchors
- Adjust meta targeting
- Create hub/spoke structure
